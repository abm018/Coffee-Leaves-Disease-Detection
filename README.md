# Coffee-leaves-disease-detection

Completed
----------
Coffee leaf diseases have a significant impact on the health and productivity
of coffee plants, affecting the quality and quantity of coffee production. Timely and
accurate detection of these diseases is essential for effective disease management.
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model called the **K-Nearest
Neighbours(KNN) model** for coffee leaf disease detection, specifically targeting three
common diseases: **Cercospora, Phoma, and Leaf Rust**. A comprehensive dataset
consisting of images of healthy coffee leaves and leaves affected by the three diseases
is collected and used for training and evaluation. The dataset is preprocessed and
augmented to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to learn discriminate features and generalize
well to unseen data. The dataset is split into train and test sets. The KNN model
is trained using the training dataset and tested using the test dataset.

To-do
